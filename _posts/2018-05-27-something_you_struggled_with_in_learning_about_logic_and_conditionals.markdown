Blog question:
What was something you struggled with in learning about Logic and Conditionals? Explain your current understanding of it.

In logic and conditionals, there are the if, else, and elsif statements. These statements are considered as part of the "conditional statements." Each of these statements represent different outcomes which are either True or False. 

I struggled for a bit during the "If Statements Lab"  because I had to decide when to use the "if", "else", or "elsif" statments to complete the lab. What actually helped me along the was was the section that talked about "Manipulating Strings" as part of the lab. This helped me solve the lab and complete the assignment.

Other than that, the directions were straight forward and I was able to utilize the errors to solve the lab. The lab also helped me complete the assignment because the "README" section broke down the directions which was easy to understand. Whenever I get stuck on something, I look to see if anyone has had the same issue and then look at how they figured out the error and start from there.
