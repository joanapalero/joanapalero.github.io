My first week on my Web Development  journey in Flatiron school started like this.

I felt like I was back in school and was so excited to meet new people. I read alot and created a mock schedule for myself. I was able to immediately get my reading done as well as labs completed before my meeting with my educational coach Melissa. She was very welcoming and resourceful. She answered my questions and immediately helped me realize how much support I have while working on the Web Development bootcamp.

She also mentioned how technical coaches work as well as the importance of starting a slack account. After my meeting with her, I immediately created a slack account and started to think about what groups to join. I joined a few groups and then said hi to everyone. 

For the rest of the week, I continued reading and completing labs in order as it came. I began to notice how the learning strategy was and got to know it better. I was starting to learn Ruby little by little. It became easier when each lesson gave me the ability to take what I read and put it into a handson exercise. 

By Sunday, I was able to complete another assignment and move on. I am liking it so far and I am determined to get Ruby done by the end of week two atleast. Wish me luck and thank you for stopping by. I will have more content on my next blog.
