According to Apple, “it is basically a way to make a program more intuitive to design, faster to develop, more amenable to modification, and easier to understand.” In my understanding, it is basically taking a regular program and upgrading it with better bells and whistles. 

For example, if an Access database was used to create reports and track data, there will be another way to enhance the database. My current project at work is to create a database using SQL server and Visual Studio. The current database that a client is using lives in an Access database and we are afraid she may lose the data if the computer ever fails on her. This Access database only works in version 2004 so only select computers have the capability of running it without any errors.

Eventually, the Access database will be obsolete and the client will transition over to the SQL database. I am excited to complete this project because the client absolutely needs another database to keep track of her work. The object-oriented approach in this scenario is to enhance the reporting, tracking, and modifying of data in the new database. Once this process is complete, there will be documentation to track every step on the way.
