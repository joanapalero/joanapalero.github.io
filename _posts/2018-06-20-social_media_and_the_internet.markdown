Research Rack and the Internet on the internet and write about something that wasn't discussed in the Learn curriculum.

The internet has grown drastically over the years. One thing that has affected its growth is social media. According to a report by Aaron Smith and Monica Anderson, "a majority of Americans use Facebook and Youtube, but young adults are especially heavy users of Snapchat and Instagram." 

Looking at this chart, it explains the trend of social media:

Personally, I was very fond of Facebook when it first came out but since the ads and the videos started, it has been more of an outlet to get people to buy something or like something. It can be a good or bad thing depending on the intentions of the person posting the ads or content. Youtube has a similar feel except that it caters more to videos than to posts. The Youtube videos also contain ads and sometimes it can be more a nuissance than it was intended for. Ads are basically everywhere.

Other social media platforms I use include Instagram, Pinterest and LinkedIn. I prefer LinkedIn for networking in a professional setting. During my undergrad years, I have used LinkedIn to apply for jobs as well as develop my resume. It has definitiely changed how someone does networking versus trying to schedule with someone one on one or in person. It can absolutely be a great tool to meet with a potential employee and the best way to screen for a job. 

Instagram was mostly a place to post pictures and videos of either your daily adventures or your product that you are trying to market. It is similar to Facebook without all the messy posts and unneccessary buttons. It is simple and people tend to stay on Instagram just as long as being on Facebook. My partner and I use Instagram to show pictures of our Great Dane Willa. Willa certainly has more followers than my partner and I do. It is also an outlet to get away from your life for a second.

Pinterest is a great tool to bookmark or "pin" everything you can think of. I've used it to pin recipes, pictures of life hacks, ideas for a room, and etc. Depending on how you like certain things, you can organize Pinterest the way you want. You can create labels for each category and people who like what you have pinned can follow your board. A board is a category that you created on your Pinterest account. I like this tool alot because Pinterest alerts me when someone liked a pin I saved or board I have.

Other than social media, the Internet has evolved from sending emails, gathering information or research, and streaming videos. There are more things the internet has done for us and one thing we need to be aware of is privacy. Our privacy is something we can control and keep if done right. If a website looks off or suspicious, you are better off closing the window and making sure you have not clicked on anything in that page. A click can either ruin you or keep you safe. When in doubt, just close the window and make sure you do not give out any of your personal information.
