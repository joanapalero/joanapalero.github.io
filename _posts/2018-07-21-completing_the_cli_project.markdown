The CLI Data Gem Project was challenging for me. The following elements are required for the project to be complete. Listed from learn.co's CLI Data Gem Project [](https://learn.co/tracks/full-stack-web-development-v5/object-oriented-ruby/final-projects/cli-data-gem-project), first, you must create a new repository on GitHub for your application. Next, step is to build your application while making sure to commit early and commit often. The next steps include recording your 30 minutes coding session with a screen capture tool. Next, you must fill in the check box under the spec.md file. After doing all the hard part, you must write a blog post about the project and its process. You will also need to create a video demo of your project as well.

Before I started the project, I brainstormed about what I wanted to do for my final project. First, I had to figure out what I want my gem to do and all the details around the functionality of the project. I had an idea to create a CLI that will call a list from a website that contains artists, their songs and a music video. After two days of trying to scrape the website, I put the project on hold. I did not want to move further without talking to my technical coach.

I was able to meet with my coach and ask him to view the website for scraping. Unfortunately, the website did not have the necessary elements I needed for my project. He advised me to use another website and try again. I tried and was able to find another website that was easier to scrape.

While I was working on my project, I was going online and watching videos and tutorials on how to set up a CLI data gem. I was able to utilize the resources provided by Flatiron and it was very helpful. The tutorials helped me understand what I needed to build the project as well as what I needed to know when creating a data gem.

After countless days, I was able to follow a tutorial and incorporate my own ideas into actual code. There are many ways to start coding, the first thing every developer should start with is listing down what you want the program to do, what attributes are needed and get someone else to review the code.

Being a developer is tough but it can be easier when you are organized and able to tell someone what your program is trying to accomplish. In my case, I am working as both the user and the developer because I want this program to work a certain way and at the same time, I am debugging the code. It is definitely a learn curve but I was able to figure out how everything connected to each other in order to execute the program. At the end of the day, if your code works the way you need it to, you can always come back and fix the design.
